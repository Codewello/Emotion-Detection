## _Emotion Detection YouTube Mini Series_


I created this [serise]('https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VAkj6iiwGkW5QTHveLhl0-E2S6WxwwG') focusing on the different ways and methods we can detect emotions in text.

With each video, you will find the code for it and an exercise to do along with its solution.
